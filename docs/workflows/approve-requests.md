# Role Based Access Control


## Creating a new project

* Any user may request a project be added to the institution's program.
* The user who requested the project is automatically given the read and write roles.
* Ony users with the data steward role  can approve and sign a request
* An administrator must create the project in the repository

## Adding a new user to a project

* Any user may request a user be added to a project.
* The `--write` flag will grant the user write access to the project.
* Ony users with the steward role can approve and sign a request

```text
g3t collaborator approve --help
Usage: g3t collaborator approve [OPTIONS]

  Sign an existing request (privileged).

Options:
  --request_id TEXT  Sign only this request
  --all              Sign all requests
  --help             Show this message and exit.

```


## Use case

# Adding Data Access Committee members

Note: This example uses the ohsu program, but the same process applies to all programs.

* A sysadmin will add the requestor role to a data-access-committee member(s) aka data steward
* Only users with the requestor role can APPROVE and SIGN adding policies within their program

```text
## As an admin, I need to grant data steward privileges add the requester reader and updater role on a program to an un-privileged user
g3t collaborator add  add data_steward_example@<institution>.edu --resource_path /programs/<program_name>/projects  --steward
# As an admin, approve that request
g3t collaborator approve



```

There are several institutions that are contributing data to ACED. Each institution has a different set of data access policies. 
Each may have different requirements for how data is accessed, and who can access it. 
Importantly, each institution may have individual who approves access to data.

## Solution

We use Gen3's role based access control (RBAC) to manage access to data.

* There is a separate `program` resource for each institution:
  * /programs/ohsu
  * /programs/stanford
  * /programs/ucl
  * /programs/manchester

Designated users within each institution have privileges to update requests. "Update" in this context means setting the status of a user's request to [SIGNED].

Since this approach relies on Gen3's [Requestor](https://github.com/uc-cdis/requestor/blob/master/docs/functionality_and_flow.md#example-backend-flow) for all assignments of policies to users we get  the following benefits:

* Tooling (command line for now, web page in the future) leverages requestor API
* Auditing of data access requests is done by requestor
