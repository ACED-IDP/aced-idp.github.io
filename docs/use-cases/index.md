# Use Cases & Workflows

The following section outlines a few workflows that a typical ACED-IDP analyst will likely encounter in their work.

These use cases all follow similar patterns of data manipulation and management with the `gen3_util` tool and data portal, so if you are unsure where to begin we recommend starting with the first link in the following:

- [Analyzing data, generating metadata and publishing to the portal](./use-case-1.md)
- [Uploading files and associating them with a patient, specimen or observation](./use-case-2.md)
- [Uploading files and associating them with a study](./use-case-3.md)
- [Restricting access to some files](./restrict-access.md)
